code:

1. **Constants and Scaling:**
   - We keep the number of neurons (40) and iterations (100) as constants.
   - The learning rate is now scaled by 10000 to work with integer arithmetic.

2. **Helper Functions:**
   - `S`: A scaling function to handle division by 10000, simulating floating-point operations.
   - `R`: A simple random number generator using the MINT `/K` operator.

3. **Array Initialization:**
   - We use a flattened 1D array for weights instead of a 2D array, which is more efficient in MINT.
   - Inputs (`x`) and outputs (`y`) arrays are pre-initialized with zeros.

4. **Weight Update Function:**
   - The weight update logic is encapsulated in the `U` function, making the main loop cleaner.
   - It uses the scaling function `S` to handle the learning rate multiplication.

5. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop is simplified, focusing on generating random inputs/outputs and calling the update function.
   - It prints the iteration number after each update.

6. **Random Number Generation:**
   - We introduce a simple random number generator using `/K` (read a character from input) and bitwise AND with #FFFF.
   - This provides more realistic input/output patterns compared to the deterministic approach in the previous version.

7. **Final Output:**
   - After the learning process, the program prints all final weights, allowing for easy inspection of the results.

8. **Optimization:**
   - By using a flattened array and pre-initializing arrays, we reduce the number of array operations, potentially improving performance.

9. **Integer Arithmetic:**
   - All calculations are done using integer arithmetic, ensuring compatibility with MINT's 16-bit integer system.

we keep the core Hebbian learning algorithm while introducing several improvements:
- easy on memory usage and array operations.
- use simple form of randomness for more realistic simulations.
- code more modular with the introduction of helper functions.
- clear output of the final weights for analysis.

To use this program:
1. Load it into your MINT environment.
2. Run it, and it will automatically perform 100 iterations of Hebbian learning.
3. After completion, it will display the final weights for all neuron connections.

hooopppppfffuuully this code providea balance between functionality, efficiency, and readability within the constraints of the MINT language. 
and plently of room for further customization, like adjusting the number of neurons or iterations, or the learning rate.
